  <h1 class="post-title">Why I made this blog</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2020-04-25</span>
  <p>I'm a recent graduate working in Edinburgh and have fairly recently being furloughed. I wanted to start really getting to grips with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> but was having trouble focusing on learning it. I was going through the truly excellent tutorials on how to make a <a href="http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/">Rougelike game</a> by bracketproductions but found myself just simply reading the tutorial. I wasn't building anything and was mostly learning about Entity Component Systems, which while interesting, doesn't really help me in my day to day job. So I needed a new project to do. One that would involve rust and a be simple enough I could guess where in the docs I needed to go to find out things.</p>
<p>I built this small blog to help me stick to my goals. A way to document what I did and write about so I have a better understanding of it. Also getting better at technical writing would be nice.</p>
<p>Next I want to start writing real rust. I'm thinking of creating an &quot;Ideas Generator&quot;. A command line tool that reads words from text files to create small sentences that are &quot;ideas&quot;. I'm basically ripping this idea off (Sebastian Lague)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--GB9qyZJqg&amp;list=PLFt_AvWsXl0ehjAfLFsp1PGaatzAwo0uK&amp;index=8] but I think its a small thing that will get me started.</p>
