I'm a recent graduate working in Edinburgh and have fairly recently being furloughed. I wanted to start really getting to grips with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) but was having trouble focusing on learning it. I was going through the truly excellent tutorials on how to make a [Rougelike game](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/) by bracketproductions but found myself just simply reading the tutorial. I wasn't building anything and was mostly learning about Entity Component Systems, which while interesting, doesn't really help me in my day to day job. So I needed a new project to do. One that would involve rust and a be simple enough I could guess where in the docs I needed to go to find out things.

I built this small blog to help me stick to my goals. A way to document what I did and write about so I have a better understanding of it. Also getting better at technical writing would be nice.

Next I want to start writing real rust. I'm thinking of creating an "Ideas Generator". A command line tool that reads words from text files to create small sentences that are "ideas". I'm basically ripping this idea off [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--GB9qyZJqg&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0ehjAfLFsp1PGaatzAwo0uK&index=8) but I think its a small thing that will get me started.
