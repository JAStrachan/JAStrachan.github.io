So currently in furlough and wanted to do more rust. I was following the excellent tutorial on making a Rougelike game in Rust but found myself following a tutorial and not building something. This website and blog is me trying to build something, a way to encourage me to build more stuff and then write about it. Hopefully it will help me get better at technical writing and produce some pretty fun Rust.
